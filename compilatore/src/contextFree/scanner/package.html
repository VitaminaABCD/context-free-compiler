Contains class and method for create and initialize grammar scanner.
Have been implemented LALR(1) bottom-up parser {@link LALR1} (LR(0) and LR(1) closure and goto have been implemented in respective class)
The LALR1 automaton is constructed through the LR0 automaton.
The lookahead symbols are calculated using an algorithm of "spontaneous generation and propagation of symbols" {@link LALR1#calculateSymbol(Automa) calculateSymbol"}
When the automaton is constructed, if the grammar is LALR(1) the Action and Goto table are created and stored inside the LALR1 instance {@link LALR1#tableCostruction() tableCostruction"}.

USAGE:
You can use the ScannerFactory class to obtain an instance:
ex:
1)you can pass a IGrammar grammar...
ScannerFactory factory = new ScannerFactory();
IScanner lalr1 = factory.createScanner(IGrammar grammar);

2)...or an InputParser instance (contains the path of grammar file, es."file.4l", and the grammar instance) 

InputParser parser = new GrammarParser(path);		
ScannerFactory factory = new ScannerFactory();
IScanner lalr1 = factory.createScanner(parser);
