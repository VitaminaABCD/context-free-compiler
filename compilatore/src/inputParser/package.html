Contains the class for file parsing. 
Only 2 extension are allowed:
1) *.4l - a file with 4 line that define a grammar:
	 	first line -> axioms
	 	second line -> non-terminals
	 	third line -> terminals
	 	fourth line -> production
 	ex: 
 	//////////grammar.4l//////////
 	E
	E, T, P
	a, +, x, (, ), $
	E::=E+T, E::=T, T::=TxP, T::=P, P::=a, P::=(E)
 	/////////////////////////////
 	
 2) *.1l - a file with 1 line that define a grammar.
 the  structure may look like this...
 	S::= { S: TE | +TE; T: FT | xFT; E : eps; F: a | (E)}
 ...where the first element is the axioms and all the element between 
 the bracket are the production.
 This format is pretty convenient associated with Action and Goto table for
 context-free grammar type.
 

You can also parse ".txt" file through LRInputParser
this type of file may contain the action and goto table and the grammar (written like *.1l grammar)
 
USAGE:
You can obtain the parsing result through the ParserFactory that return 
a proper instance initialized with the result of parsing.
ex.
- get a grammar instance from a grammar file:
	IGrammar grammar = (IGrammar) new InputParser("grammar.4l").parse();

- get an instance of parser program from a "Result.txt" file (contains action and goto table and the grammar in *.1l format):
	ParserProgram parserProgram = (ParserProgram) new InputParser("Result.txt").parse();
